# Pokedex
 Modern Pokedex Web Application This is a dynamic web application that displays the original 151 Pokémon using data fetched from the PokeAPI. Built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, the project features a responsive grid layout where each Pokémon card is color-coded based on its primary elemental type. Users can search for specific Pokémon in real-time, and the app uses asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) to ensure smooth data retrieval and rendering.

 Key Features 
Dynamic Data Fetching: Automatically retrieves Pokémon info (ID, name, weight, type) from an external API.

Real-time Search: Filter Pokémon instantly by typing their names.

Responsive Design: Clean, modern, and mobile-friendly interface.

Type-based Styling: Cards change color dynamically based on the Pokémon's type.
